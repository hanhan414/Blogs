During my visit to the South London Gallery, I was captivated by Paola Estrella's artwork, "A Timeless Parallel." This short film is a brilliant display of the artist's imagination and creativity. Through filming, collage, and editing, she transformed every window of an ordinary residential building into an entrance to a parallel world. The residents of this world wear various animal headgear, but they engage in everyday activities such as reading, cooking, and playing musical instruments.

One of the things I love about this artwork is that it satisfies our human desire to peek into other people's lives from the perspective of a window. After viewing this piece, I read some interviews with the artist, and she revealed that her inspiration during quarantine came from observing her neighbors' windows. This sparked her creativity, and she was able to turn this beautiful imagination into reality. This reminded me of the fairy tales I read as a child, where the magical world existed right under our noses.

As I observed this artwork, I realized that Paola Estrella is more of a storyteller than an artist. Her ability to weave a narrative through her artwork is impressive. It is similar to the father in the movie "Big Fish" who tells stories about people and events from his life through art to his son. This artwork highlights the power of observation and imagination, as Estrella drew inspiration from simply observing her neighbors during a period of isolation. It serves as a reminder that inspiration can be found in the most unexpected places, and that the creative process can be fueled by everyday experiences and observations.

Although the techniques used in this artwork are not complex, the simple editing methods effectively create a magical world. This artwork proves the fact that art is a byproduct of human imagination and thought. Any tool can be used as a means of expression, and technological advancements have given us more convenient ways of expression. We can now learn and create computational art, which gives us more diverse forms of expression. However, we should not be bound by complex technology. The essence of any artwork is still the most important part.

In contemporary art exhibitions, I often encounter simple works paired with various complex explanations. I do not enjoy these works. In contrast, Paola's short film does not require much explanation, and the work itself can inspire many ideas for viewers. Paola's artwork not only captivated me with its creative use of editing and imagery, but also with its underlying themes. Through the use of parallel universes and animal headwear, the piece explores the idea of identity and the ways in which we construct and present ourselves to the world. The fact that these characters are engaged in mundane, everyday activities only emphasizes the point that our identities are not defined solely by our actions or appearance, but rather by the stories we tell ourselves and others about who we are.

Overall, visiting the exhibition and appreciating Paola Estrella's artwork was an incredible experience. This artwork is a beautiful display of the artist's imagination, and it took me to a magical world. I am glad to have had the opportunity to see this artwork, and it left a deep impression on me.
